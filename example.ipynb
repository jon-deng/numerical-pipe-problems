    "# Numerical solution of pipe problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for flow rate $Q$ in pipe problems is often tricky because pressure/heads are related to flow rate through complicated functions.\n",
    "In the case of pipe losses, there is the dependence of friction factor on Reynold's number (the flow speed in Reynolds number is related to $Q/A$). \n",
    "This makes it difficult to analytically \"move $Q$ to one side\" of the equation and solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For practical problems you usually have to solve for $Q$ numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to do this is to rearrange the equation so that the solution is a 'root'. \n",
    "You might have learned strategies like this in your \"SYDE 311: Advanced mathematics\" course.\n",
    "This is shown below."
